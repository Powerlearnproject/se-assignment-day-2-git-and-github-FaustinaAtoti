## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to source code over time. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously and helps prevent conflicts between different versions of files.
GitHub is a popular platform for version control because it integrates with Git, a distributed version control system. Github makes it easy for developers to work on the same project. GitHub hosts repositories in the cloud, making them accessible from anywhere. GitHub has a large community of developers which makes it a great place to share and discover open- source projects. 
Version control belps in maintaining project integrity by tracking changes thereby allowing developers to see who made the changes and why. It allows reverting changes in the case of mistakes.
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Log in to your github account.
Click the "+" icon in the upper right corner of any GitHub page
